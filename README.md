# NETWORK-ADRESSING-AND-BASIC-TROUBLESHOOTING

Latency
Definition: The amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another, including any delays.
Impact: High latency can cause delays in data transmission, making applications like online gaming or video calls laggy.

Throughput
Definition: The amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a given period of time.
Reality Check: Throughput is often lower than the maximum bandwidth due to various factors like network traffic, type of traffic, and latency caused by network devices.
Bottleneck: A single segment with low throughput in a multi-segment network can limit the overall throughput, creating a bottleneck.

Goodput
Definition: The measure of usable data transferred over a given period, excluding traffic overhead (e.g., session establishment, acknowledgments, encapsulation, retransmitted bits).
Reality Check: Goodput is always lower than throughput, which is generally lower than the bandwidth.

Factors Influencing Throughput
Traffic Volume: Higher traffic can reduce throughput.
Traffic Type: Different types of traffic have varying impacts on throughput.
Network Devices: The number and type of devices between the source and destination can affect latency and, consequently, throughput.
